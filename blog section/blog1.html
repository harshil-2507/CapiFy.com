      <h3>Understanding Stock Market Charts</h3>
      <p>
        Stock market charts are crucial tools for investors and traders. They
        visually represent the price movements and trading volumes of stocks,
        helping to identify patterns and trends. By studying these charts, one
        can make informed decisions about when to buy or sell stocks.
        Understanding the different types of charts and how to interpret them is
        the first step towards mastering stock market analysis.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of Stock Market Charts</h3>
      <h4>Line Charts</h4>
      <img src="images\line-chart.png" alt="line-chart example">
      <p>
        These are the simplest form of charts, showing the closing prices of
        stocks over a period. They are great for identifying long-term trends
        but lacks detailed information.
      </p>

      <h4>Bar Charts</h4>
      <img src="images\bar-graph.webp" alt="bar-chart example">
      <p>
        These charts provide more information than line charts. Each bar
        represents a trading day, showing the opening, closing, high, and low
        prices. Bar charts help in understanding the daily price range and
        trends.
      </p>

      <h4>Candlestick Charts</h4>
      <img src="images\candlestick-chart.png" alt="candlestick-chart example">
      <p>
        Popular among traders, candlestick charts offer a visual representation
        of price movements. Each candlestick shows the opening, closing, high,
        and low prices for a specific period. The body of the candlestick
        indicates the price range between opening and closing, while the wicks
        represent the high and low prices.
      </p>

      <h4>Point and Figure Charts</h4>
      <img src="images\point-and-figure.png" alt="point-and-figure example">
      <p>
        These charts focus on price movements without considering time. They are
        useful for identifying significant price changes and trends, filtering
        out minor price fluctuations.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Elements of Stock Market Charts</h3>
      <p>
        To make correct judgments based on stock market charts, it’s essential
        to understand their key elements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Price:</strong> The most critical element, representing the
          value of the stock at any given time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Volume:</strong> Indicates the number of shares traded during
          a specific period. High volume often accompanies significant price
          movements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time Frame:</strong> Charts can be set to different time
          frames, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. Choosing the right time
          frame depends on your trading strategy and investment goals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Identifying Trends</h3>
      <p>
        Trends are the general direction in which a stock’s price is moving.
        They can be upward (bullish), downward (bearish), or sideways (neutral).
        Identifying trends is crucial for making trading decisions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Uptrend:</strong> Characterized by higher highs and higher
          lows. It indicates a positive market sentiment and suggests buying
          opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Downtrend:</strong> Marked by lower highs and lower lows. It
          reflects negative market sentiment, signaling selling or short-selling
          opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sideways Trend:</strong> When the price moves within a narrow
          range, neither rising nor falling significantly. It suggests
          indecision in the market and can indicate a potential breakout in
          either direction.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Technical Indicators</h3>
      <p>
        Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on the price,
        volume, or open interest of a stock. They help in predicting future
        price movements. Some commonly used indicators include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Moving Averages:</strong> These smooth out price data to
          identify the direction of the trend. The most common are the simple
          moving average (SMA) and the exponential moving average (EMA).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</strong> Measures the speed and
          change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100, with values above
          70 indicating overbought conditions and below 30 indicating oversold
          conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Top 10 Practical Stock Market Trends</h3>
